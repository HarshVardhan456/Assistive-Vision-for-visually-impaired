Assistive vision technologies for the visually impaired enhance independence and quality of life by leveraging optical, digital, and AI-based systems. Examples include screen readers like JAWS, which convert text to speech, and smart glasses such as eSight that enhance low vision through high-resolution video. Mobile apps like Seeing AI narrate the visual environment, while devices like OrCam MyEye provide real-time audio descriptions of text and objects. Navigation aids such as GPS-based devices and cane sensors help with orientation and mobility, and home assistance technologies, including voice-activated assistants and smart home integrations, offer greater control over daily activities. These innovations collectively empower visually impaired individuals to navigate their surroundings and access information more effectively.
